    "r: It is used to open the file in reading mode.If the file is not present the FILE NOT EXISTS error arrises\n",
    "\n",
    "w: It is used to open the file in reading mode. If the file already exists, its contents are truncated, and the file is opened in write mode. If the file doesn't exist, a new file is created. \n",
    "\n",
    "a: It is used to open the file in append mode or wditing mode which is already existing. The file pointer is placed at the end of the file, and if the file doesn't exist, a new file is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "x: It is used to create a new file and open it for writing. If the file already exists, a FileExistsError arrises.\n",
    "\n",
    "b: It is used to open a file in binary mode. It is generally used when working with non-text files such as images, videos, or audio files.\n",
    "\n",
    "t: It is used to open a file in text mode. It is the default mode when opening a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "+: It is used with \"r\" and \"w\" to open a file for both reading and writing. This is used when you want to update the contents of a file.\n"
