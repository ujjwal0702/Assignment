    "Web scraping is an automatic method to obtain large amounts of data from websites. Most of this data is unstructured data in an HTML format which is then converted into structured data in a spreadsheet or a database so that it can be used in various applications. There are many different ways to perform web scraping to obtain data from websites. These include using online services, particular API’s or even creating your code for web scraping from scratch. Many large websites, like Google, Twitter, Facebook, StackOverflow, etc. have API’s that allow you to access their data in a structured format. This is the best option, but there are other sites that don’t allow users to access large amounts of data in a structured form or they are simply not that technologically advanced. In that situation, it’s best to use Web Scraping to scrape the website for data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping requires two parts, namely the crawler and the scraper. The crawler is an artificial intelligence algorithm that browses the web to search for the particular data required by following the links across the internet.

    "Methods of web scrapping are:\n",
    "* Copy-pasting. The manual human examination and copy-pasting method may sometimes prove irreplaceable. At times, this technique may be the only practical method to use especially when websites are setup with barriers and machine automation cannot be enabled.\n",
    "\n",
    "* DOM Parsing. In order to dynamically modify or inspect a web page, client-side scripts parse the contents of the web page into a DOM tree. By embedding a program into the web browser, you can then retrieve the information from the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "* HTTP Programming. Using socket programming, posting HTTP requests can help one retrieve dynamic as well as static web page information.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Recognizing Semantic Annotation. Most web pages have semantic annotations/markup or metadata that can be easily retrieved. This could be a simple case of DOM parsing if the metadata is just embedded in the web page. Web scrapers can also use the annotations located in the semantic layer of the web page before actually scraping it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Text Grepping. Using Python programming languages or Perl, one can use the UNIX grep command to extract valuable data and information from web pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Web scraping Software. If you do not want to manually use web-scraping codes, you can make use of a software that can do the web scraping for you. It can automatically retrieve the information off the web page, convert it into recognizable information, and store it in a local database."
